# Tobimune Shell Mini-Apps (src/core/app)

The `src/core/app/` directory houses custom mini-applications built specifically for Tobimune Shell. Instead of relying on heavy standalone applications, Tobimune Shell creates native-feeling desktop widgets by cleverly combining existing Linux tools with custom bash and Python scripts.

Currently, the following mini-apps are available:
- [**Taskbar**](#the-taskbar-srccoreapptaskbar)
- [**Desktop Icons**](#desktop-icons-srccoreappdesktop-icons)
- [**Rounded Screen**](#rounded-screen-srccoreapprounded-screen)
- [**Edge Trigger**](#edge-trigger-srccoreappedge-trigger)

## The Taskbar (`src/core/app/taskbar`)

The Taskbar is a Windows-style taskbar that sits at the bottom of your screen. Interestingly, it is not a standalone program! Under the hood, it is actually a highly customized, secondary instance of **Waybar** running a specific configuration (`~/.config/waybar/taskbar/config`). 

Because it runs independently from your main top status bar, it has its own dedicated management system.

### `taskbar_manager.sh` (The Control Center)
This is the master script that controls the Taskbar's lifecycle and settings. It acts as the bridge between the Rofi `Tobimune Menu` and the underlying Waybar process.

- **State Management:** It uses `~/.local/state/tobimune/` to remember if you turned the Taskbar on or off (`taskbar_manual_state`). When you reboot, passing `--startup` to this script ensures your Taskbar returns exactly as you left it.
- **The Master Switch (`--toggle`):** This command completely enables or disables the Taskbar. 
- **Taskbar App Name (`--app-name`):** Toggles whether the Taskbar displays application names next to icons. It achieves this by dynamically parsing and rewriting a JSON state file (`taskbar-theme`).
- **Icon Sizing (`--icon-size`):** Prompts you via a Rofi text input to enter a custom pixel size, rather than cycling through fixed sizes, and updates the Waybar configuration on the fly.

### `taskbar_geticon.sh` (The Icon Fetcher)
The Taskbar needs to display the correct icons for your pinned applications.
- **What it does:** It reads your personal list of pinned apps from `~/suzaku/config/taskbar-pin-apps`. 
- **Icon Resolution:** Since Linux apps don't always have straightforward icon paths, this script hunts through your `/usr/share/icons/`, `~/.local/share/icons/`, and current GTK icon theme to find the highest resolution SVG or PNG that matches the app's desktop entry, ensuring your dock always looks crisp. 
- **Caching & Theme Detection:** It intelligently caches the resolved icons and accurately detects your current GTK theme to speed up fetching times and provide better matching for dynamically changing themes.

## Desktop Icons (`src/core/app/desktop-icons`)


### `desktop_icons.py` (The Engine)
This is a surprisingly powerful Python application built on top of `GtkLayerShell` and `Cairo`. Instead of being a normal window, it draws itself directly onto the background layer of your screen, sitting quietly beneath all your other windows.

- **Full Interactivity:** It isn't just a static picture! It supports double-clicking to launch apps, dragging boxes to multi-select, holding `Ctrl` to select specific files, and even keyboard shortcuts like `Ctrl+C` (Copy) and `Ctrl+X` (Cut). Added interactive options enhance how Tobimune Shell elements are managed.
- **Drag & Drop:** It natively integrates with Wayland's Drag and Drop API. 
  - You can drag files from Thunar (or any file manager) straight onto your desktop. 
  - You can freely drag icons around to rearrange them. The grid positions are automatically saved to a `positions.json` file so they stay exactly where you left them after a reboot!
- **Auto Arrange:** Tired of messy desktops? The application now features an Auto Arrange mode (enabled by default) that automatically snaps your icons into a neat grid, ensuring your desktop always looks organized.
- **Customizable Actions:** By default, dragging a file *onto* the desktop copies it, while dragging a file *off* the desktop cuts it. You can change this behavior (e.g., creating symlinks instead of copying) in its configuration file.

### `desktop_icons_manager.sh` (The Launcher)
Just like the Taskbar, the Desktop Icons app has its own manager script that links to the Tobimune Menu.
- **What it does:** It tracks the ON/OFF state of the desktop icons in `~/.local/state/tobimune/desktop_icons_state`.
- **Usage:** You can use `--toggle` to instantly show or hide all your icons, `--reload` to refresh the grid (useful if you just pasted a new file via the terminal), or `--startup` to automatically launch the python engine when you log in.

### Configuration
You can customize almost everything about how your icons look and behave.
- **Where:** Check `~/suzaku/config/desktop-icons/desktop-icons.conf`.
- **Options:** You can change the icon size, sorting method (by name, date, size), whether to show hidden files, or toggle the visibility of special system folders like `Home`, `Trash`, and `Computer`.

## Rounded Screen (`src/core/app/rounded-screen`)

A sleek overlay that frames your entire monitor with perfectly rounded corners and a configurable border thickness, giving your display a modern, hardware-like bezel aesthetic. 

### `rounded_screen.py` (The Renderer)
To bypass limitations in Wayland's layer-shell protocol (which doesn't let a single surface reserve exclusive space on all four edges without breaking other panels), this application uses a brilliant multi-window architecture:
- **The Main Window:** Placed on the `TOP` layer. It spans the entire physical screen and draws the beautiful rounded corners and border.
- **Dynamic Mode:** You can toggle "Dynamic Mode" from the Tobimune Menu. When disabled, it anchors 4 invisible dummy edges to reserve exclusive space and forces itself across the screen using a negative exclusive zone. When enabled, it respects other panels' exclusive zones (like Waybar), allowing itself to be pushed inward dynamically for perfect layout integration.

### `rounded_screen_manager.sh` (The Controller)
Manages the lifecycle of the Rounded Screen overlay.
- **Toggling & Startup:** Controlled via `--toggle`, `--startup`, and `--toggle-dynamic`. The main toggle hooks into the Tobimune Menu's Theme section, while Dynamic Mode is located in the Setting section.
- **State Management:** Remembers if you had it turned on or off across reboots using `~/.local/state/tobimune/rounded_screen_state` and `rounded_screen_dynamic_state`.

### Configuration
You can customize the appearance by editing `~/suzaku/config/rounded-screen.conf`.
- **`border_thickness`**: Thickness of the black frame (e.g., 4px).
- **`border_radius`**: How curved the corners should be (e.g., 20px).

## Edge Trigger (`src/core/app/edge-trigger`)

An invisible overlay that sits at the edges of your screen, allowing you to trigger specific commands simply by hovering your mouse against the screen borders.

### `edge_trigger.py` (The Sensor)
Using `GtkLayerShell` on the `OVERLAY` layer with a negative exclusive zone, this Python script creates small, invisible hover zones on your screen edges. It intelligently sits on top of all other panels (like Waybar) so it's never blocked.
- **Dwell Time:** Prevents accidental triggers by requiring your mouse to rest in the zone for a configurable amount of time (`dwell_ms`) before activating.
- **Cooldown:** Implements a timeout (`cooldown_ms`) after a successful trigger to prevent rapid, unintended repeated executions.

### Auto-Close Mechanism (Guard Window)
To improve the user experience, edge-triggered menus automatically close when the mouse leaves a designated "safe zone".
- When an edge successfully triggers its command, it spawns a full-screen, invisible **guard window**.
- Using `cairo` input shapes, the guard window has a "hole" cut out corresponding to the active menu's safe zone.
- As long as the mouse stays inside the menu's area (the hole), clicks pass through normally. The moment the mouse moves out and touches the guard window, the script automatically sends a termination command (e.g., `pkill -x rofi` or `swaync-client -cp`) and destroys the guard window.

**Current Safe Zones:**
- **Top (`hakumenu.sh`):** Upper 60% of the screen.
- **Bottom (`wallpaper_select.sh`):** Lower 60% of the screen.
- **Left (`shutdown.sh`):** Leftmost 15% of the screen.
- **Right (`swaync`):** Rightmost 40% of the screen.

### `edge_trigger_manager.sh` (The Controller)
Manages the lifecycle of the Edge Trigger overlay.
- **Toggling & Startup:** Controlled via `--toggle` and `--startup`. Integrated directly into the Tobimune Menu's Theme section. It also supports `--reload` to restart the overlay and `-h`/`--help` for usage information.
- **State Management:** Remembers if you had it turned on or off across reboots using `~/.local/state/tobimune/edge_trigger_state`.

### Configuration
- **`dwell_ms`**: Time in milliseconds the pointer must stay on the edge to trigger (default: 200).
- **`cooldown_ms`**: Minimum time in milliseconds between consecutive triggers (default: 800).
- **Individual Lengths:** You can specify the exact length of each trigger zone independently (e.g., `edge_top_length_percent`, `edge_right_length_percent`). Both `left` and `right` triggers are shifted down by 10% from the top.
- You can enable/disable individual edges (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) and define the exact shell command each executes.

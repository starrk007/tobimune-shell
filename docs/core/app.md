# HakuSpace Mini-Apps (src/core/app)

The `src/core/app/` directory houses custom mini-applications built specifically for HakuSpace. Instead of relying on heavy standalone applications, HakuSpace creates native-feeling desktop widgets by cleverly combining existing Linux tools with custom bash and Python scripts.

Currently, the following mini-apps are available:
- [**Taskbar**](#the-taskbar-srccoreapptaskbar)
- [**Desktop Icons**](#desktop-icons-srccoreappdesktop-icons)
- [**Rounded Screen**](#rounded-screen-srccoreapprounded-screen)
- [**Edge Trigger**](#edge-trigger-srccoreappedge-trigger)
- [**Cava Underbar**](#cava-underbar-srccoreappcava-layer)

## The Taskbar (`src/core/app/taskbar`)

The Taskbar is a Windows-style taskbar that sits at the bottom of your screen. Interestingly, it is not a standalone program! Under the hood, it is actually a highly customized, secondary instance of **Waybar** running a specific configuration (`~/.config/waybar/taskbar/config`). 

Because it runs independently from your main top status bar, it has its own dedicated management system.

### `taskbar_manager.sh` (The Control Center)
This is the master script that controls the Taskbar's lifecycle and settings. It acts as the bridge between the Rofi `Haku Menu` and the underlying Waybar process.

- **State Management:** It uses `~/.local/state/hakuspace/` to remember if you turned the Taskbar on or off (`taskbar_manual_state`). When you reboot, passing `--startup` to this script ensures your Taskbar returns exactly as you left it.
- **The Master Switch (`--toggle`):** This command completely enables or disables the Taskbar. 
- **Taskbar App Name (`--app-name`):** Toggles whether the Taskbar displays application names next to icons. It achieves this by dynamically parsing and rewriting a JSON state file (`taskbar-theme`).
- **Icon Sizing (`--icon-size`):** Prompts you via a Rofi text input to enter a custom pixel size, rather than cycling through fixed sizes, and updates the Waybar configuration on the fly.

### `taskbar_geticon.sh` (The Icon Fetcher)
The Taskbar needs to display the correct icons for your pinned applications.
- **What it does:** It reads your personal list of pinned apps from `~/hakucfg/config/taskbar-pin-apps`. 
- **Icon Resolution:** Since Linux apps don't always have straightforward icon paths, this script hunts through your `/usr/share/icons/`, `~/.local/share/icons/`, and current GTK icon theme to find the highest resolution SVG or PNG that matches the app's desktop entry, ensuring your dock always looks crisp. 
- **Caching & Theme Detection:** It intelligently caches the resolved icons and accurately detects your current GTK theme to speed up fetching times and provide better matching for dynamically changing themes.

## Desktop Icons (`src/core/app/desktop-icons`)

One of the biggest sacrifices when moving from traditional Desktop Environments (like XFCE or KDE) to modern Wayland compositors (like Hyprland or Niri) is losing your desktop icons. HakuSpace solves this by bringing them back with a fully native, Wayland-compatible desktop icon renderer!

### `desktop_icons.py` (The Engine)
This is a surprisingly powerful Python application built on top of `GtkLayerShell` and `Cairo`. Instead of being a normal window, it draws itself directly onto the background layer of your screen, sitting quietly beneath all your other windows.

- **Full Interactivity:** It isn't just a static picture! It supports double-clicking to launch apps, dragging boxes to multi-select, holding `Ctrl` to select specific files, and even keyboard shortcuts like `Ctrl+C` (Copy) and `Ctrl+X` (Cut). Added interactive options enhance how HakuSpace elements are managed.
- **Drag & Drop:** It natively integrates with Wayland's Drag and Drop API. 
  - You can drag files from Thunar (or any file manager) straight onto your desktop. 
  - You can freely drag icons around to rearrange them. The grid positions are automatically saved to a `positions.json` file so they stay exactly where you left them after a reboot!
- **Auto Arrange:** Tired of messy desktops? The application now features an Auto Arrange mode (enabled by default) that automatically snaps your icons into a neat grid, ensuring your desktop always looks organized.
- **Customizable Actions:** By default, dragging a file *onto* the desktop copies it, while dragging a file *off* the desktop cuts it. You can change this behavior (e.g., creating symlinks instead of copying) in its configuration file.

### `desktop_icons_manager.sh` (The Launcher)
Just like the Taskbar, the Desktop Icons app has its own manager script that links to the Haku Menu.
- **What it does:** It tracks the ON/OFF state of the desktop icons in `~/.local/state/hakuspace/desktop_icons_state`.
- **Usage:** You can use `--toggle` to instantly show or hide all your icons, `--reload` to refresh the grid (useful if you just pasted a new file via the terminal), or `--startup` to automatically launch the python engine when you log in.

### Configuration
You can customize almost everything about how your icons look and behave.
- **Where:** Check `~/hakucfg/config/desktop-icons/desktop-icons.conf`.
- **Options:** You can change the icon size, sorting method (by name, date, size), whether to show hidden files, or toggle the visibility of special system folders like `Home`, `Trash`, and `Computer`.

## Rounded Screen (`src/core/app/rounded-screen`)

A sleek overlay that frames your entire monitor with perfectly rounded corners and a configurable border thickness, giving your display a modern, hardware-like bezel aesthetic. 

### `rounded_screen.py` (The Renderer)
To bypass limitations in Wayland's layer-shell protocol (which doesn't let a single surface reserve exclusive space on all four edges without breaking other panels), this application uses a brilliant multi-window architecture:
- **The Main Window:** Placed on the `TOP` layer. It spans the entire physical screen and draws the beautiful rounded corners and border.
- **Dynamic Mode:** You can toggle "Dynamic Mode" from the Haku Menu. When disabled, it anchors 4 invisible dummy edges to reserve exclusive space and forces itself across the screen using a negative exclusive zone. When enabled, it respects other panels' exclusive zones (like Waybar), allowing itself to be pushed inward dynamically for perfect layout integration.

### `rounded_screen_manager.sh` (The Controller)
Manages the lifecycle of the Rounded Screen overlay.
- **Toggling & Startup:** Controlled via `--toggle`, `--startup`, and `--toggle-dynamic`. The main toggle hooks into the Haku Menu's Theme section, while Dynamic Mode is located in the Setting section.
- **State Management:** Remembers if you had it turned on or off across reboots using `~/.local/state/hakuspace/rounded_screen_state` and `rounded_screen_dynamic_state`.

### Configuration
You can customize the appearance by editing `~/hakucfg/config/rounded-screen.conf`.
- **`border_thickness`**: Thickness of the black frame (e.g., 4px).
- **`border_radius`**: How curved the corners should be (e.g., 20px).

## Edge Trigger (`src/core/app/edge-trigger`)

An invisible overlay that sits at the edges of your screen, allowing you to trigger specific commands simply by hovering your mouse against the screen borders.

### `edge_trigger.py` (The Sensor)
Using `GtkLayerShell` on the `OVERLAY` layer with a negative exclusive zone, this Python script creates small, invisible hover zones on your screen edges. It intelligently sits on top of all other panels (like Waybar) so it's never blocked.
- **Dwell Time:** Prevents accidental triggers by requiring your mouse to rest in the zone for a configurable amount of time (`dwell_ms`) before activating.
- **Cooldown:** Implements a timeout (`cooldown_ms`) after a successful trigger to prevent rapid, unintended repeated executions.

### Auto-Close Mechanism (Guard Window)
To improve the user experience, edge-triggered menus automatically close when the mouse leaves a designated "safe zone".
- When an edge successfully triggers its command, it spawns a full-screen, invisible **guard window**.
- Using `cairo` input shapes, the guard window has a "hole" cut out corresponding to the active menu's safe zone.
- As long as the mouse stays inside the menu's area (the hole), clicks pass through normally. The moment the mouse moves out and touches the guard window, the script automatically sends a termination command (e.g., `pkill -x rofi` or `swaync-client -cp`) and destroys the guard window.

**Current Safe Zones:**
- **Top (`hakumenu.sh`):** Upper 60% of the screen.
- **Bottom (`wallpaper_select.sh`):** Lower 60% of the screen.
- **Left (`shutdown.sh`):** Leftmost 15% of the screen.
- **Right (`swaync`):** Rightmost 40% of the screen.

### `edge_trigger_manager.sh` (The Controller)
Manages the lifecycle of the Edge Trigger overlay.
- **Toggling & Startup:** Controlled via `--toggle` and `--startup`. Integrated directly into the Haku Menu's Theme section. It also supports `--reload` to restart the overlay and `-h`/`--help` for usage information.
- **State Management:** Remembers if you had it turned on or off across reboots using `~/.local/state/hakuspace/edge_trigger_state`.

### Configuration
- **`dwell_ms`**: Time in milliseconds the pointer must stay on the edge to trigger (default: 200).
- **`cooldown_ms`**: Minimum time in milliseconds between consecutive triggers (default: 800).
- **Individual Lengths:** You can specify the exact length of each trigger zone independently (e.g., `edge_top_length_percent`, `edge_right_length_percent`). Both `left` and `right` triggers are shifted down by 10% from the top.
- You can enable/disable individual edges (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) and define the exact shell command each executes.

## Cava Underbar (`src/core/app/cava-layer`)

If you like having an audio visualizer on your desktop, you've probably used `cava`. Normally, it runs inside a regular terminal window. HakuSpace takes it to the next level by embedding `cava` directly into the background of your screen, sitting just above your wallpaper but below your windows, acting as a dynamic "Underbar". It also features an "Top Mode" to make the visualizer sit above all other windows!

### `cava_layer.py` (The VTE Wrapper)
This Python script uses `GtkLayerShell` and `VTE` (Virtual Terminal Emulator).
- **Layer Shell Embedding:** It creates a borderless, completely transparent, and click-through terminal window. Depending on the settings, it renders either in the `BOTTOM` layer (under windows) or the `TOP` layer (above windows).
- **Theme Syncing:** It dynamically parses your `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` to extract your current foreground, background, and accent colors, ensuring the visualizer perfectly matches your overall system theme.
- **Running Cava:** It quietly spawns the actual `cava` C-binary inside this invisible terminal window to process your audio streams.

### `cava_manager.sh` (The Process Controller)
Because the Python script acts as a background daemon, it needs a manager to handle its lifecycle.

**Developer Note on CLI conventions:** Be aware that unlike other manager scripts in HakuSpace which primarily use long flags (e.g., `--toggle`, `--reload`), `cava_manager.sh` utilizes positional sub-commands (`start`, `stop`, `toggle`, `reload`) mixed with flags (e.g., `-t`/`--top`, `-d`/`--toggle-dynamic`).

- **Toggling:** You can use `cava_manager.sh toggle` (which is mapped in the Haku Menu's Theme tab) to spawn or gracefully kill the visualizer process and its PID file.
- **Top Mode & Dynamic Mode:** You can use `cava_manager.sh --top` to toggle the top layer mode, or `--toggle-dynamic` to toggle Dynamic Mode (which adapts to other panels' exclusive zones). The manager gracefully saves these states to `~/.local/state/hakuspace/cava_overlay_state` and `cava_dynamic_state` and makes them accessible in the Haku Menu.
- **Live Reloading:** When you change your system's accent color (via `gen_style.sh`), you don't want the audio visualizer to stutter, drop frames, or restart. Calling `cava_manager.sh reload` sends a specific UNIX signal (`SIGUSR1`) to the Python daemon. The script intercepts this signal, re-reads the Kitty configuration, and instantly updates the visualizer's colors on the fly without ever interrupting the live audio stream!

# How Does HakuSpace Work?

See the Vietnamese version: [VN_architecture](./vietnamese/VN_architecture.md).

Here is a quick overview for *you* to understand what's in my dotfiles and how they get installed on your machine.

## How Are Dotfiles Managed?

HakuSpace uses a **Hybrid System**: you can choose between **Deep Symlinking** or **Classic Copying**.
(It doesn't use Stow or Git worktrees).

- `src/home/` acts like your home directory. This is the BASE config.
- `~/hakucfg/` is where you put your personal stuff. It acts as a template in the repo. This is the CUSTOM config.
- Depending on your choice during `install.sh`, your configs are either symlinked (edits sync instantly) or copied (edits stay local).

## How Do I Use These Dotfiles?

### `install.sh` (First-time Setup)
- This is the main script to get everything running. Here is its step-by-step logic:
  - **Phase 1: Prompting:** Asks for your Distro, preferred Window Manager, and deployment mode (Symlink or Copy).
  - **Phase 2: Backup:** Scans your system and safely moves any conflicting files to `~/.backup/Backup_<timestamp>`.
  - **Phase 3: Dependencies:** Reads the text files in `src/packages/` and installs the required packages using your package manager. **Important:** The script applies a strict regex filter (`^[a-zA-Z0-9@._+-]+$`). Lines with version constraints (e.g., `>=1.0`), spaces, or other characters will be silently dropped!
  - **Phase 4: Deployment:** 
    - Links or copies everything from `src/home/.config/` and `src/core/` to your machine.
    - Handles the `ONCE_CONFIGS` group (always copied, never symlinked).
    - Initializes your custom `~/hakucfg` space from the template.
  - **Phase 5: Post-install:** Fixes script permissions and sets Fish as default shell.

### `update.sh` (Applying Updates)
- Run this whenever you pull fresh code from GitHub.
  - **Phase 1: Repository Update:** Prompts you to choose between LATEST (main branch) or STABLE (latest tag) to update the repository.
  - **Phase 2: Backup & Mode Detection:** Creates a safety net in `~/.backup/` before touching anything. It then heuristically scans your currently deployed files to determine whether you are using Symlink or Copy mode.
  - **Phase 3: Smart Sync:** 
    - Redeploys all configs and scripts based on your mode.
    - Intelligently **Skips** the `ONCE_CONFIGS` to preserve your GUI tweaks (like Thunar or btop settings).
    - Ignores your `~/hakucfg/` completely so your personal stuff stays safe.
    - Note: explicitly skips `OPTIONAL` packages, they are only offered during initial installation.

### `rollback.sh` (The Undo Button)
- Run this if an update breaks your system.
  - **Phase 1: Selection:** Lists all available backups in `~/.backup/` and lets you pick one (defaults to the newest).
  - **Phase 2: Safe Cleanup:** 
    - Carefully removes current HakuSpace symlinks. This prevents accidental dereferencing which could wipe out files inside the Git repo.
  - **Phase 3: Restoration:** Copies all files from the chosen backup back to their exact original locations in `~/.config` and `~/.local/bin`.

### `doctor.sh` (The Health Checker)
- A diagnostic tool, incredibly useful if you chose Symlink mode.
  - **Broken Symlinks Scan:** Checks your `~/.config` and `~/.local/bin` for symlinks that point to nowhere (because the target file was deleted or moved), and highlights them in red.
  - **Overwritten Files Scan:** Detects files that should be symlinks managed by HakuSpace, but were somehow turned into real files (usually because your text editor broke the symlink when saving). The doctor points them out and tells you to run `update.sh` to fix them.

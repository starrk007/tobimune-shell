## Installation Guide

> [!tip]
> For Fedora users, you should follow the [Fedora Guide](docs/fedora_guide.md)

### 0. Prerequisites:

- You have completed the installation of Arch, Fedora, and NixOS (or derivative distros)
- You have installed and configured essential utilities such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Audio,... and necessary hardware drivers.
- You are familiar with configuring the system via **code**, as my dotfiles do NOT have a central graphical settings GUI.

### 1. Clone the Dotfiles
- Stable Release (Recommended):
```bash
cd ~
git clone --depth 1 --branch v26.10-1 https://github.com/hakuimaku/hakuspace.git ~/hakuspace

```
- If you prefer to experience the **lastest changes**:
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/hakuimaku/hakuspace.git ~/hakuspace

```

### 2. Run the Installation Script

```bash
cd hakuspace
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### 3. Complete the Installation
After running the installation script, restart your computer and log in to either **Hyprland**, **Niri**, **Mango** or **Labwc** to experience the new setup.

### 4. After Installation
1) Change the GTK theme:
- Go to `GTK Settings` in Rofi App Menu (SUPER + R).
- Change the theme, icons, and mouse cursor for a better aesthetic.

2) **Install additional packages**:

`waybar-cava` is a plugin for Waybar that provides a visualizer for audio output. My waybar top needs this to work properly (cava module).

```bash
yay -S waybar-cava
```

3) Allow Local Root User to Access X/Xwayland Display
```bash
xhost +si:localuser:root
```
Grants the local root user permission to connect to and launch graphical (GUI) applications (like `GParted`) within the current user's active X server or Xwayland session.


## Dotfiles Management

Haku Space provides built-in scripts to safely manage your dotfiles using a flexible deployment mechanism:
- **Deployment Mode**: Files are automatically managed via **Symlink** (default, allowing instant updates when source files change) or **Copy** mode during installation.
- **Customization**: All your personal tweaks should be done inside the `~/hakucfg` directory, keeping the core system clean and untouched.

See more in: [Management & Deployment](docs/management.md)

### Update Haku Space
Simply run the `update.sh` script in the hakuspace folder. This will safely update the core files while preserving your personal settings in `~/hakucfg`.
```bash
cd ~/hakuspace
chmod +x update.sh
./update.sh
```

### Rollback Haku Space
Restore files from a backup created by `install.sh` or `update.sh`.
```bash
cd ~/hakuspace
chmod +x rollback.sh
./rollback.sh
```
If multiple backups are available, the newest one is selected by pressing Enter.

### Uninstall Haku Space
> (WM: The Window Manager you are currently using, e.g., hyprland, niri, mango).

- Run `rollback.sh` to restore your previous configuration.
- Remove all scripts located in `~/.local/bin`.
- Delete the auto-generated files in `~/.local/state/hakuspace`.
- If necessary, you can also remove the icons and themes inside `~/.icons` and `~/.themes`.
- Review `pkg-core.txt`, `pkg-service.txt`, `pkg-optional.txt` and `pkg-WM.txt` (in `src/packages/`) to uninstall any unnecessary packages.

---

## Performance

Haku Space is designed to balance aesthetic features and resource efficiency. Below is the RAM usage breakdown based on a system with **16GB RAM**:

- **Fresh Arch Linux + Dotfiles (Base):** ~1.1 GB RAM
- **Taskbar enabled:** +77 MB
- **Desktop Icons enabled:** +100 MB
- **Cava Underbar enabled:** +100 MB (High CPU usage)
- **Rounded Screen enabled:** +70 MB
- **Edge Trigger enabled:** +60 MB

**Total:** If you use all the built-in mini-apps simultaneously, it will consume at least **~1.5 GB RAM** upon startup.

> [!note]
> During your actual workflow, RAM consumption will naturally expand further depending on the applications you use and your specific needs.

---

## NixOS Configuration

> [!important]
> I've not maintained the NixOS version. Every bugs will not be fixed.

See the main configuration file at [hakuspace-config.nix](nix/hakuspace-config.nix)

> [!note]
> My dotfiles do not use `home-manager` feature rn. I'm not currently using NixOS, next time I use it again, I will develop home-manager feature for NixOS. Or you can contribute it :D
>
> Manage dotfiles by run `install.sh` and `update.sh` script. `hakuspace-config.nix` just a basic setup packages and programs.

* Simply clone this repository and run the `install.sh` script exactly as outlined [above](#installation-guide).
* You can use either method: online remote via [flake.nix](nix/flake.nix.example) or offline by directly importing `hakuspace-config.nix` into your `configuration.nix` (2 modes already have install flow in script `install.sh`).
* `hakuspace-config.nix` does not set a display manager by default, as it may conflict with your existing display manager.
* 2 current options in `hakuspace-config.nix` that you can enable/disable in your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  hakuspace = {
    enable = true; # Enable the full hakuspace config
    enableFishShell = true; # Enable Fish shell
  };
}

```

> [!important]
> Nixpkgs I use is stable, which still install **hypridle** v0.1.7.
> Please install **hyprilde** unstable nixpkgs for v0.1.8 (to use my [idle_inhibit.sh](src/core/sys/idle_inhibit.sh) script).

## Plugin Configuration (Hyprland Only)

You can immediately use the plugins that I have pre-configured. Simply install and enable them using the commands below (or tweak them as you like in `plugin.lua`).

* **[hyprexpo](https://github.com/sandwichfarm/hyprexpo)** - Overview layout for your workspaces.
* **[hypr-dynamic-cursors](https://github.com/VirtCode/hypr-dynamic-cursors)** - Smooth, physics-based dynamic cursor effects.

```bash
hyprpm update

hyprpm add https://github.com/virtcode/hypr-dynamic-cursors
hyprpm enable dynamic-cursors

hyprpm add https://github.com/sandwichfarm/hyprexpo
hyprpm enable hyprexpo

hyprpm reload
```

## Troubleshooting

**Waybar issues**:
- **Waybar clock**: You should set your timezone and locale manually in waybar configuration to ensure the clock displays correctly.
- **Waybar cava module**: If you encounter issues with the Cava module in Waybar, ensure that you have installed `waybar-cava` and that it is properly configured in your Waybar config file.
- Waybar use `ext/workspaces` for **Multi-WMs** setup.

**My dotfiles issues**:
- Some features might still be missing since I only tested this setup for **my personal use**. If you need more than what's provided, you'll need to install and configure those parts manually.
- If you don't want to use certain apps (like `wl-screenrec`, `thunar`, `ly` etc.), you can easily remove and replace them with alternatives. However, some apps are deeply integrated into my scripts or configs, so removing them may break functionality or cause those scripts/configs to stop working.
- If you find that **the script isn't working**, run it directly in the terminal to see what the error is.
- If you encounter any **issues** during installation or configuration, just ask me in some video on my [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@hakuimaku2372), open an issue on GitHub or Join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/Juuun8sXsN) to get more help!. I will do my best to help you out.

If you're using **Fedora**:
- Swaync service may automatically start on Fedora. Which can **cause issues when startup**. To fix this, you can disable the Swaync service by running the following command:
```bash
systemctl --user disable swaync.service
```
